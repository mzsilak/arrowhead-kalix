 * <h1>Binary Data Transfer Object Utilities</h1>
 * This package contains utilities complementary to those of the {@link
 * se.arkalix.dto DTO} package when dealing with binary or RAW data. As most
 * kinds of data either begin their lives or ends up as raw bytes, the
 * utilities here will tend to be used by higher-level readers and writers.
